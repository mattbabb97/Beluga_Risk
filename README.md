Title: Risk sensitivity in female beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas)

Summary: This study explores how beluga whales respond to uncertain choices. We tested four female beluga whales to see if they preferred a guaranteed food reward (safe choice) or a gamble with equal chances of getting nothing or double the reward (risky choice).

Key Findings:
- Two whales preferred the safe choice, while two preferred the risky choice.
- Time of day (morning vs. afternoon) influenced how strongly some whales stuck to their choices but didn’t change their overall preference.
- Past results (previous trials) didn’t affect their decisions.
- Each whale had a stable preference, highlighting individual differences in decision-making.

Repository contains both .xlsx files containing the data and .RMD files containing the code to run all statistical tests and figure generation

Beluga Analysis [FINAL].RMD
	This file uses the data from Beluga_Master_File.xlsx which contains all the data from the risk sensitivity paradigm of our 4 subjects. 
	This is trial level data with each row representing one beluga's decision on a given trial.
	This .RMD file generates all figures in the manuscript.

Instructions:
	All .RMD files are separated into chunks and titled with the purpose of the chunk.
	The chunks are intended to be run in sequential order, from Line 1 onward.
	To run a chunk on PC, simply press CTRL+Enter to run it and move to the next chunk.
	
	All figures are automatically saved as .png files into the Working Directory
